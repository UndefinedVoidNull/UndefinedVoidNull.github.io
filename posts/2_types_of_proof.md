## Intro

There are two common types of proofs

1\. If $P$, then $Q$. ($P \implies Q$)

2\. $P$ iff $Q$ ($P \iff Q$)

Remark: `iff` stands for `if and only if`

## If $P$, then $Q$

There are two ways to prove

1\. Conditional Proof

2\. Proof by Contradiction

3\. Proof by Contrapositive

4\.  Proof by Induction

## $P$ iff $Q$

There are two ways to prove

1\. Prove $P \implies Q$ and then prove $Q \implies P$ (First prove forward $\implies$ and then prove backward $\impliedby$)

2\. A chain of `iff` $$
\begin{align*}
&P \\
&\iff R \\
&\iff \dots\\
&\iff Q
\end{align*}
$$

## Where to start

1.  Start from $P$ (Which part of $P$?)
2.  Start from $Q$ (Which part of $Q$?)
3.  Start from $P$ and $Q$ at the same time (Which part of $P$, $Q$?)

### by what?

1.  by the sense of direction
2.  by cases
3.  by examples
4.  by graph
5.  by attempts
6.  by analogy
7.  by pattern-method
8.  by experiences
9.  by intuition

Now we know where to start

## The first step and further steps?

1.  by definition
2.  by theorem or propositions
3.  by transformations/operations
4.  by techniques
5.  by axioms

## Change the focus point

When you

1.  (have no idea how to carry on) get stuck
2.  (know how to carry on but) find it super hard/complex to going forward in this direction
3.  finished this part
4.  feeling I might ignored some important points/things
